#fader.js

Fader.js is a stand-alone (no dependencies) micro js that implementes the fade-in and fade-out effect on html elements. It attempts a CSS3 transition, and if not supported, degrades to a JS based animation.

##Usage
###Basics
You can either let Fader find the element, through:

```javascript
// "elemId" => the id of the element to be faded out
// 5        => the animation duration
Fader.fadeOutWithId("elemId", 5);

// "elemId" => the id of the element to be faded in
// 3        => the animation duration
Fader.fadeInWithId("elemId", 3);

// "elemClass" => the class of the element to be faded out
// 0           => the element index, in the retrieved objects, to be faded
// 4           => the animation duration
Fader.fadeOutWithClass("elemClass", 0, 4);

// "elemClass" => the class of the element to be faded in
// 1           => the element index, in the retrieved objects, to be faded
// 2           => the animation duration
Fader.fadeInWithClass("elemClass", 1, 2);
```

Or, find the element your self and pass it to Fader, through:
```javascript
// elem => the element to be faded in
// 6    => the animation duration
Fader.fadeInElement(elem, 6);

// elem => the element to be faded out
// 1    => the animation duration
Fader.fadeOutElement(elem, 1);
```

You can use even callback functions that fires after fade effect:
```javascript
Fader.fadeOutElement(elem, 0.5, function(){
  elem.style.display = 'none';
});
```
